Either there is no mention of them and thus are either deemed unnecessary, favouring diving into the &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of the project or task at hand, or are expected prior knowledge. In this post, I hope to elucidate the importance of a virtual environment, how to go about setting one up for Python Data Science projects, and also the process of managing and maintaining an environment. Please note that there are several ways of setting up virtual environments, and different setups may be more or less optimal for other users, but I will cover venv and conda, which I believe are the most accessible, and should be more than enough to get you started. If you&rsquo;re in Windows, a) I&rsquo;m sorry, and b) perhaps this <a href=https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-setup-a-python-virtual-environment-on-windows-10/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">resource</a>
would be more useful for you.</p><h2 id=what-is-a-virtual-environment-and-why-should-i-care>What is a virtual environment, and why should I care?<a class=anchor href=#what-is-a-virtual-environment-and-why-should-i-care>#</a></h2><p>Much like it sounds, a virtual environment is an isolated environment, segregated from your global machine, that allows for version control – particularly in relation to individual projects. Since Python can release 10 or more new versions a year, maintaining some kind of <strong>consistency</strong> is crucial when you want assurance that your work is unaffected by changes when an update has taken place. Nothing is worse than realising that your system has updated, going back to a project that needs a small tweak, and realising that there are more breaks than you know what to do with. Whether you use your work or home computer for your Python projects, your system can also become a little crowded with packages and libraries – especially if you&rsquo;re like me and can&rsquo;t wait to get your teeth into a new project – and <strong>managing the different dependencies</strong> of interrelated libraries and packages can be exhausting. From a backend perspective, there is also the consideration of where these modules are stored. Modules imported in Python (using the <code>import</code> function) are stored in a different location to packages imported at the command-line using <code>pip</code> – the difference lies in whether the modules are part of the Python standard library or not. I won&rsquo;t go into this any further here, but I will refer you to <a href=https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>
if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more.</p><p>Knowing what each project actually <em>needs</em> is important when you&rsquo;re building out projects for another user, team, or client. A virtual environment allows you to monitor your imported libraries, controls which version of Python you are using and manages dependencies with different packages, and ultimately allows you to pass on the requirements of a project alongside the project code itself. It also allows for you to set up different dependencies for different projects (have a client that only works in Python2? No problem!).</p><h2 id=which-virtual-environment-is-right-for-me>Which virtual environment is right for me?<a class=anchor href=#which-virtual-environment-is-right-for-me>#</a></h2><p>In this tutorial, I&rsquo;m going to cover two different virtual environments. The first, <code>venv</code> is available by default in Python 3.3 or later. <code>conda</code> environments, on the other hand, can be powerful when used alongside Jupyter notebooks, since it acts as both a package and environment manager and is language agnostic.</p><p>Honestly, there is no &ldquo;best&rdquo; environment, and your choice will likely come down to how much setup and maintenance you&rsquo;re comfortable with, as well as whether you need the additional features that virtualenv and conda provide.</p><h2 id=using-and-managing-virtual-environments--the-workflow-with-venv>Using and managing virtual environments – the workflow with venv<a class=anchor href=#using-and-managing-virtual-environments--the-workflow-with-venv>#</a></h2><p>Ok, so I&rsquo;m starting a new project, which I&rsquo;m going to call <code>my-awesome-ds-project</code>. If you&rsquo;re new to data science, I highly recommend taking a look at <a href=https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">cookie cutter data science</a>
as a structure for your data science projects. I modify mine slightly to look like this:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>my-awesome-ds-project
|––README.md
|––data				#data dump, raw, interim, and processed data
|––models			#trained models, model predictions
|––notebooks		#Jupyter notebooks
|––references 		#explanatory material
|––reports			#presentations, reports, figures
|––src				#source code, scripts for use in the project
|––tests			#making sure my code does what I think it does
</code></pre><p>So far, so good! To set up a virtual environment, all you need to do is navigate to your project directory and execute the venv module (I&rsquo;m going to call mine <code>awesome_venv</code>, but feel free to name it whatever you please):</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% cd my-awesome-ds-project
% python3 -m venv awesome_venv/
</code></pre><p>Now your new directory <code>awesome_venv</code> is inside your project folder:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>my-awesome-ds-project
|––README.md
|––awesome_venv		#oh, hello there
|––data				
|––models			
|––notebooks		
|––references 		
|––reports			
|––src				
|––tests			
</code></pre><p>Now, if you were to take a peek inside your new venv folder, it would look something like this:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>awesome_venv
├── bin
│   ├── activate
│   ├── activate.csh
│   ├── activate.fish
│   ├── easy_install
│   ├── easy_install-3.5
│   ├── pip
│   ├── pip3

├── include
├── lib
│   └── python3.5
│       └── site-packages
└── pyvenv.cfg
</code></pre><p>Not wanting to overcomplicate things here, but an overview of the three main subfolders:</p><ul><li><code>bin</code> contains files that interact with the virtual environment</li><li><code>include</code> contains C headers that compile the Python packages</li><li><code>lib</code> contains a copy of the Python version along with the <code>site-packages</code> where each module or package is managed</li></ul><p>To activate the new virtual environment, we need to use the <code>bin/activate</code> path:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% source awesome_venv/bin/activate
(awesome-venv) %					
</code></pre><p>Look at that! The command line prompt now shows that you&rsquo;re working inside your virtual environment. Now we can really get our teeth into our project!
By default, only <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> are installed inside a virtual environment, so any additional library you need to use will need to be installed separately, using the <code>pip install</code> method below.
If you&rsquo;re used to doing all your code at the command line or in .py files, then you can work on your project as usual at this point. But if you&rsquo;re using Jupyter notebooks, then a little more setup is required.
While in your virtual environment, run the following, which will install the jupyter notebook onto your virtual environment (you will only need to do this once per virtual environment you set up):</p><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-venv) % pip install jupyter notebook
(awesome-venv) % pip install ipykernel==4.8.2 #syntax for installing a specific version
(awesome-venv) % python -m ipykernel install --user
(awesome-venv) % jupyter notebook notebooks/my-file.ipynb #leave the last argument blank to open a new notebook
</code></pre><p>This gets you up and going straight away, without needing to go through the Anaconda system. The ipykernel module allows you to use your virtual environment from within Jupyter notebooks.
So, here are the bare bones of a notebook. First of all, you can see in the top right corner that we are in the global Python3 kernel (it&rsquo;s not obvious, but all will become clear in a moment)
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FDreams-and-Deliberations%2FDG9klIeyZc.jpg?alt=media&token=5303980e-8b52-453c-894a-54cd4d301fd4" alt>
From there, you just need to switch into the venv from the kernel menu:
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FDreams-and-Deliberations%2FJ1XaPeAUb5.jpg?alt=media&token=f399bfc5-24ba-4cea-8c45-ad72b59787e5" alt>
Now that your environment is set up, you can almost work on your projects as normal – just remember to install the modules you use <strong>before</strong> you use them, otherwise you will have a horrible warning message:
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FDreams-and-Deliberations%2FhEM_eBwPcT.jpg?alt=media&token=433651a4-12a3-4f85-a881-f811910992dc" alt>
To do this inside Jupyter notebooks, use the following command (the <code>!</code> allows you to use command line arguments from within your notebook)
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FDreams-and-Deliberations%2FmsjwJSICmT.jpg?alt=media&token=c13412f2-5088-4aad-8809-9179f6c97b1f" alt>
You can then continue with your project (I&rsquo;m still mourning the end of Schitt&rsquo;s Creek)
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FDreams-and-Deliberations%2Fzl7JFp2cMr.jpg?alt=media&token=1ec08587-0883-4cc0-b17c-2ad107efc849" alt>
And that&rsquo;s all there is to it! Before I move onto the conda method, I just want to go over how to manage the venv environment.</p><h3 id=managing-environments>Managing environments<a class=anchor href=#managing-environments>#</a></h3><p>So it might have occurred to you that installing packages one-by-one might get a little tedious. Luckily, there&rsquo;s a solution for that. But before I get on to how to install those dependencies en masse, let&rsquo;s take a little detour (there&rsquo;s a point, I promise).</p><p>So you&rsquo;re working on a project, and your colleague, Jenny, decides that the awesome new model you built could be useful for something that she&rsquo;s working on. The question is, how does she set up her environment so that she can be sure that the model will run on her system without a hitch? Enter the <code>requirements.txt</code> file, which allows us to make our environment reproducible for others and, thankfully, is super simple to create.</p><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-venv) % pip list #not strictly necessary
(awesome-venv) % pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre><p>After completing the second command, your project folder will look like this:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>my-awesome-ds-project
|––README.md
|––awesome_venv		
|––data				
|––models			
|––notebooks		
|––references 		
|––reports	
|––requirements.txt			#hello!
|––src				
|––tests
</code></pre><p>This is super important when distributing your project because, if Jenny were to try to pull down your project from your GitHub repository and use your virtual environment, it could cause major problems, for instance, if she&rsquo;s running on a different operating system. To minimise the guesswork, it&rsquo;s best to stick with <code>requirements.txt</code> files (for now at least), and remove your venv files when uploading to a repository.</p><p>Coming back to the issue of installing multiple dependencies at once, all Jenny would need to do, once she&rsquo;s cloned your repository, is to create her own virtual environment and install the <code>requirements.txt</code> file:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>Jenny% cd test-project
Jenny% python3 -m venv test-venv/
Jenny% source test-venv/bin/activate
(test-venv) Jenny% pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre><p>Now Jenny is up and ready to go!</p><p>One final thing. When you&rsquo;re done in your environment and want to go back to running commands in your global machine, use the deactivate command to return to the &ldquo;status-quo&rdquo;:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-venv) % deactivate
%
</code></pre><h3 id=troubleshooting>Troubleshooting<a class=anchor href=#troubleshooting>#</a></h3><p>Of course, life isn&rsquo;t easy. There might still be some issues that crop up with dependencies between your global and virtual machines. If that happens, the easiest fix is to remove the old virtual environment, and recreate it from your own <code>requirements.txt</code> file:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% rm -r awesome-venv/
% python3 -m venv wonder-venv/
% source wonder-venv/bin/activate
(wonder-venv) % pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre><p>You <em>should</em> be operational at this point, but if not, I refer you to the <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58117467/python-venv-not-creating-virtual-environment target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">forums</a>
of many frustrated venv users.</p><h2 id=using-and-managing-virtual-environments--the-workflow-with-conda>Using and managing virtual environments – the workflow with conda<a class=anchor href=#using-and-managing-virtual-environments--the-workflow-with-conda>#</a></h2><p>Now, the very cool thing about <code>conda</code> environments is that a) the environment is language agnostic, which means that you can use other languages if you&rsquo;re multilingual (I won&rsquo;t be doing this here, but for a very good post, read <a href=https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-conda-environments-bc6180fc533>https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-conda-environments-bc6180fc533</a>) and b) conda does the job of both <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> and both manages the packages you install and the environment itself. Neat, huh?</p><p>To create an environment with <code>conda</code> for Python, you can use the following command (replacing <code>awesome-conda-env</code> with the name of your choice):</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% conda create --name awesome-conda-env python
</code></pre><p>Conda is smart. If there is a specific library you need to install, you could simply name the package during the installation step, and <code>conda</code> would <em>work out</em> which dependencies and language you are using. The recommendation from conda is that all packages are installed at once for this reason – because dependencies are managed during installation, there may be a problem later on – the last package you install typically will determine the outcome of dependency conflicts. See the <a href=https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#installing-packages target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation</a>
for more details.</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% conda create --name awesome-conda-env numpy
</code></pre><p>Finally, you can activate your environment and install packages:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% conda activate awesome-conda-env
(awesome-conda-env) % conda install numpy=1.20.1 pandas=1.2.4
(awesome-conda-env) % conda install jupyter notebook
</code></pre><p>By explicitly telling your environment the specific packages you wish to use, you essentially &ldquo;pin&rdquo; the environment to using these versions unless you update them manually.</p><p>Some packages are not available through the [Anaconda Repository()], but instead can be found through Anaconda Cloud, which provides access to various channels, including <a href=https://anaconda.org/conda-forge target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">conda-forge</a>
and <a href=https://anaconda.org/bioconda target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">bioconda</a>
. For these, a small modification will be needed:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-conda-env) % conda install --channel conda-forge ipykernel
</code></pre><ul><li>Conda has approximately 25,000 available libraries through Anaconda Repository, conda-forge, and bioconda, but this pales in comparison to the ~150,000 available through PyPI. As a result, you may still need to use pip to install some libraries, as follows – note that you do not have to install <code>pip</code> separately because it is already included within anaconda:</li></ul><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-conda-env) % pip install datetime
</code></pre><p>Note that the <a href=https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">recommendation</a>
from anaconda is that you install all Anaconda packages first, and install pip environments at the end of your modifications to your environment. The reason for this is that the conda environment is less able to manage dependencies for pip-installed libraries, and modifications made after installing libraries via pip might break your environment. Thankfully, conda keeps track of where your packages where installed from (Note: there are many automatically-installed packages to manage dependencies, but for ease of reading I have trimmed the view below):</p><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-conda-env) % conda list
# packages in environment at /Users/user_name/opt/anaconda3/envs/awesome-conda-env:
#
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
datetime                  4.3                      pypi_0    pypi
ipykernel                 5.5.5            py39h71a6800_0    conda-forge
ipython                   7.23.1           py39h71a6800_0    conda-forge
jupyter_client            6.1.12             pyhd8ed1ab_0    conda-forge
jupyter_core              4.7.1            py39h6e9494a_0    conda-forge

python                    3.9.4                h88f2d9e_0
</code></pre><p>One small point to note is that unlike venv, where your environment is a directory in your project folder, creating conda virtual environments as in my example above is easiest, but will require that you name each of your environments different names, since they will all be stored in the same env directory. To list them, use the following command (note the <code>*</code> indicates the default env – since I performed the command while inside my active environment, it shows awesome-conda-env as being default, but outside the env, your base will be default):</p><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-conda-env) % conda env list
# conda environments:
#
base                     /Users/user_name/opt/anaconda3
awesome-conda-env     *  /Users/user_name/opt/anaconda3/envs/awesome-conda-env
</code></pre><p>Finally, to get up and running in Jupyter notebooks as before, you will need to run the following:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>python -m ipykernel install --user --name=awesome-conda-env
</code></pre><p>There are some tricky things about conda, such as where your environments live and different installation methods based on where the packages can be found – be that Anaconda Repository, other Conda repositories, such as Anaconda Cloud, or the PyPI library. It&rsquo;s worth seeing whether the package you want to use is available (and updated frequently) through Anaconda before installing via pip to avoid dependency hell. However, the advantages of using conda might outweigh these difficulties. Because Conda is a cross-platform package, packages installed through Conda are binaries, which means that you don&rsquo;t require a compiler to install them and, helpfully, this enables packages to be available in C, R, or other languages. As a result, the conda environment manager can contain software written in any languages, and has a satisfiability solver to verify that all requirements of all packages installed in an environment are met (and will notify you if there is a discrepancy), so long as you use conda&rsquo;s package manager rather than <code>pip</code>. In this sense, conda environments can be a little more reliable. Additionally, you can potentially work with different versions of Python in the same environment (if that is something you need). This <a href=https://www.anaconda.com/blog/understanding-conda-and-pip target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>
is a great resource for understanding more of the advantages of using conda over pip.</p><h3 id=managing-your-conda-environment>Managing your conda environment<a class=anchor href=#managing-your-conda-environment>#</a></h3><p>As before, we need to make our environment reproducible for others by including a file in the project&rsquo;s root directory listing packages installed along with their version numbers. With conda, instead of creating a <code>requirements.txt</code> file, we create an <code>environment.yml</code> file as follows:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-conda-env) % conda env export --file environment.yml
</code></pre><p>Given an <code>environment.yml</code> file, you can then easily re-create an environment:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% conda env create --name test-env --file /path/to/environment.yml
</code></pre><p>Note that, unfortunately <code>.yml</code> and <code>.txt</code> files cannot be used interchangeably between environments, so this might be something to consider when working on a team with people who mostly use <code>venv</code>, for instance.</p><p>One <em><em>really cool</em></em> thing about conda is that if you are someone who uses a core set of packages, say <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code>, you can set up your anaconda configuration so that these packages are installed as standard in any new environment:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% conda config --add create_default_packages numpy=1.20.1 pandas=1.2.4
</code></pre><p>This can ultimately save you so much time if you consistently need to install multiple packages each time you create an environment.</p><p>Finally, to deactivate your environment, simply run</p><pre><code class=language-shell>(awesome-conda-env) % conda deactivate
%
</code></pre><h2 id=summary>Summary<a class=anchor href=#summary>#</a></h2><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information packed into this post, so here are the key points to take away.</p><p>Virtual environments help to:</p><ul><li><strong>Resolve dependency issues</strong> by allowing you to use different versions of a package for different projects if needed, or even install packages regardless of whether you have admin privileges on that machine.</li><li>Make your project <strong>self-contained</strong> and <strong>reproducible</strong>.</li><li>Keep your folders tidy!</li></ul><p>Whether you use <code>conda</code> or <code>venv</code> largely comes down to personal preference, but:</p><ul><li><code>venv</code> environments tend to run a little faster, and can be operated from inside your project folder, keeping all your project needs in one place. <code>venv</code> itself has no dependency manager, but there are packages out there, such as <a href=https://python-poetry.org/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">poetry</a>
that act more like conda (I just haven&rsquo;t quite managed to get around to trying it out yet!).</li><li><code>conda</code> acts both as an environment and package manager, and ensures that dependencies are met for all conda-downloaded packages (note that while you can install PyPI packages via <code>pip</code>, conda is less able to manage those dependencies). As a result, packages take slightly longer to download, but this might be worth it in the long run! Conda is also language-agnostic, if you frequently operate in, say, R as well as Python.

To do this, you can list the available kernels from the terminal and remove your choice using the commands below:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>% jupyter kernelspec list
# Available kernels:
  awesome-conda-env                                                    /Users/user_name/Library/Jupyter/kernels/awesome-conda-env
  python3                                                              /Users/user_name/Library/Jupyter/kernels/python3
  awesome_venv                                                         /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/awesome_venv

% jupyter kernelspec uninstall awesome_venv awesome-conda-venv
